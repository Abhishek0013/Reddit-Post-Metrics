# Reddit-Post-Metrics
Project Scope: To predict the score of a Reddit post and understand what features contribute to a higher score using Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark on Databricks platform.  
Tasks Completed:  
•	Performed feature engineering like one-hot encoding and count vectorization, statistical tests like Correlation Matrix for feature removal, IQR test to remove outliers on the Reddit post dataset.  
•	Modelling and tuning regression algorithms: linear regression, random forest , XGBoost and best accuracy was found for random forest regressor using SparkML and  performed exploratory analysis on significant features.
